## Intro

Hey, I'm Venkataram Edavamadathil Sivaram (Venki). I am an avid computer programmer currently studying at UC San Diego. My main interests include computer graphics (e.g. raytracing and physically based rendering) and reinforcement learning.

## Project Highlights

- [Kobra](https://github.com/vedavamadathil/kobra): A physically-based renderer specializing in state of the art ray-tracing tehcniques.
- [Zhetapi](https://github.com/vedavamadathil/zhetapi): A C++ library for machine learning and numerical analysis.
- [RL Racing](https://github.com/vedavamadathil/rl-racing): Reinforcement learning simulation for cars in a race track.
- [Contrained Fitting Paper](https://github.com/vedavamadathil/constrained-fitting): An exploratory survey of algorithms for solving the constrained fitting problem.
- [Vm](https://github.com/vedavamadathil/vm): An 8-bit virtual machine.
